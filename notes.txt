To Do:
- setup the skeleton for Log2 (model, route, components, main.component)
- refactor Date to use DatePicker plugin
- include Time (plugin?)
- Want to log all Todos for the day into 1 Log object which can be opened to see the Todos of the day
- add Completed? in Todos

Todos
    List

Logs
    List of Todo Lists by Date (can be opened)
    - Each one is a snapshot of the Todo List of each saved day

- idea is that the Todos are per day, therefore should be cleared and remade on a daily basis\

- Save button for the Todos -> when pressed will create a new "Log2" with the snapshot of all the Todos from the day
- will require a GET from todos and a POST to "Log2"
- should also have an update button -> just overwrite the previous data for the Date
- 

Calendar:
- Add a calendar to access logs from previous dates?
- Using DatePicker plugin
